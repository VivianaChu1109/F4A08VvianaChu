		<h1> Hi! I am Viviana Chu Weng Lam~</h1>
		<p>My name is Viviana Chu. I am a F4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section). I have a sister who is a graduate of SHCCES. </p>
		<p>About me, I love the colour lilac and I think that a life without chocolate and cola is a nightmare. Moreover, I am sporty and always participate in competitions. I used to play basketball before but now I am a member of the school Volleyball Team and I have been a setter, middle blocker and outside hitter in these years and I am now an opposite in the team. </p>
		<p>On the other hand, I have learnt different instruments, like piano and violin when I was a child but I gave it up when I promoted to primary. I planned to learnt piano again when I graduate from school, which would be exciting!</p>
